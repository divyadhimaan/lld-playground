# Design Expense Sharing App: Splitwise

An expense sharing application is where you can add your expenses and split it among different people. The app keeps balances between people as in who owes how much to whom.


## Requirements

2. Users should be able to create groups and add other users to the groups. 
3. Users should be able to add expenses within a group, specifying the amount, description, and participants. 
4. The system should automatically split the expenses among the participants based on their share. 
5. Users should be able to view their individual balances with other users and settle up the balances. 
6. The system should support different split methods, such as equal split, percentage split, and exact amounts. 
7. Users should be able to view their transaction history and group expenses. 
8. The system should handle concurrent transactions and ensure data consistency.
