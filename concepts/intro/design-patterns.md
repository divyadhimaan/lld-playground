# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems that help structure code in a reusable, maintainable, and scalable way. 

In Low-Level Design (LLD), design patterns provide guidelines for implementing class structures, object interactions, and code organization.


## Types of Design Patterns

1. Creational Design Patterns - (Object Creation & Instantiation)
2. Structural Design Patterns - (Object Composition & Relationships)
3. Behavioral Design Patterns - (Object Interaction & Communication)
