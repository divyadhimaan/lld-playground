# Spring Boot Overview



Spring Boot is an open-source framework built on top of Spring Framework to simplify the development of Java-based applications, particularly microservices.

It provides a convention-over-configuration approach, reducing boilerplate code and making application setup quicker and more efficient.


## Why Spring Boot?

Traditional Spring Framework requires extensive configuration, making it complex to set up. Spring Boot simplifies this by providing:

- Auto-configuration: Automatically configures beans based on classpath dependencies.
- Standalone Applications: Embeds Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, eliminating the need for external servers.
- Production-ready Features: Includes health monitoring, metrics, logging, and security out-of-the-box.
- Simplified Dependency Management: Uses Spring Boot Starters to group dependencies logically.


## Use Cases of Spring Boot
- Microservices Architecture
- RESTful Web Services
- Enterprise Web Applications
- Standalone CLI Applications
- Cloud-Native Development (Spring Cloud)

Spring Boot is an excellent choice when you need a fast, scalable, and production-ready Java application with minimal configuration.
