# Builder v/s Decorator


#### Analogy where both might confuse:

You walk into a coffee shop. You want your ideal cup of coffee, possibly with different ingredients and extra add-ons.

- `Builder Pattern Thinking`: I want to construct a specific coffee step-by-step, with full control over each part. 
  - You are focused on constructing a product from the ground up, one configuration at a time.
  - You assemble ingredients using a `CoffeeBuilder`.
- `Decorator Pattern Thinking`: I already have a base coffee, now I want to add features dynamically.
  - You’re wrapping and layering behaviors on top of a ready-made coffee.
  - You start with a `BasicCoffee` object. 
  - You wrap it with `ExtraShot`, then `WhippedCreamDecorator`, and so on.

# Facade vs Proxy

#### Analogy where both might confuse:

Imagine you want to watch a movie:

- `Facade Thinking`: 
  - Instead of buying tickets, adjusting the sound system, dimming the lights, and starting the movie yourself, you just press “Play Movie” on a home theater remote. 
  - The facade hides the complexity of all subsystems and gives you a simplified interface.

- `Proxy Thinking`: 
  - You could watch the movie directly, but instead, you go through a movie rental service agent. 
  - The agent controls access (e.g., checking subscription, caching, restricting bandwidth). 
  - You still get the same movie, but with an additional layer of control/optimization.

| Aspect               | **Facade Pattern**                                                          | **Proxy Pattern**                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intent**           | Provide a **simplified interface** to a complex subsystem                   | Provide a **surrogate/placeholder** to control access to a real object. Follows same interface. |
| **Focus**            | Hiding complexity of multiple subsystems                                    | Controlling access, adding extra behavior (security, caching, lazy loading)                     |
| **Used When**        | Clients need easy access to a complex system without learning its internals | Direct access is expensive, sensitive, or needs additional control                              |
| **Resulting Object** | A high-level interface that delegates work to multiple classes              | A stand-in object that forwards requests to the real object                                     |
| **Pattern Type**     | Structural                                                                  | Structural                                                                                      |
| **Structure**        | Facade → Subsystems                                                         | Client → Proxy → RealSubject                                                                    |
| **Flexibility**      | Simplifies client usage, but doesn’t usually extend functionality           | Adds flexibility by intercepting calls and adding logic before/after delegation                 |
| **Example**          | `HomeTheaterFacade` to start movie (lights, projector, sound)               | `ImageProxy` that loads an image lazily only when needed                                        |

# Facade vs Adapter

#### Analogy where both might confuse

You walk into a coffee shop:

- `Facade Thinking`: 
  - You just say “Give me a Latte”. 
  - Behind the counter, the barista coordinates the grinder, espresso machine, milk steamer, and cashier. 
  - You don’t see the complexity — you just use a simple unified interface.

- `Adapter Thinking`: 
  - You brought your own coffee mug from home, but the coffee shop machines only accept their own cups. 
  - Instead of changing the machine, the shop provides a cupholder adapter so your mug fits. 
  - The adapter translates between incompatible interfaces.

| Aspect               | **Facade Pattern**                                                            | **Adapter Pattern**                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intent**           | Provide a **simplified interface** to a complex subsystem                     | Convert the **interface of one class into another** expected by clients           |
| **Focus**            | Hiding internal complexity                                                    | Making incompatible interfaces work together                                      |
| **Used When**        | Clients shouldn’t need to know subsystem details                              | You want to reuse existing classes but their interface doesn’t match requirements |
| **Resulting Object** | A high-level interface that internally coordinates many subsystems            | A wrapper object that **translates method calls**                                 |
| **Pattern Type**     | Structural                                                                    | Structural                                                                        |
| **Structure**        | Facade → Subsystems                                                           | Client → Adapter → Adaptee                                                        |
| **Flexibility**      | Simplifies usage, but doesn’t change subsystem behavior                       | Adds flexibility by **bridging mismatched interfaces**                            |
| **Example**          | `HomeTheaterFacade` that starts movie (lights, sound, projector all together) | `SquarePegAdapter` that lets a `SquarePeg` fit into a `RoundHole`                 |
