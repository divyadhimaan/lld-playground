# Key Factors for Code Quality

1. **Readability**: 
   - The importance of writing code that is easy to understand, both for oneself and other engineers. 
   - Clear, readable code simplifies debugging, facilitates modifications, and enhances team collaboration. Poor readability, on the other hand, increases engineering costs and can negatively impact the organization.

2. **Extensibility**: 
   - Code should be structured to allow seamless extensions as requirements evolve. 
   - A well-designed system enables the addition of new features with minimal disruption to existing code, reflecting a strong team culture and showcasing an engineerâ€™s adaptability.

3. **Correctness**: 
   - Writing correct code is fundamental to establishing credibility as an engineer. Undetected bugs in production can lead to significant costs for organizations. 
   - Just as reliability is critical in various engineering disciplines, ensuring the accuracy and robustness of code is a key professional responsibility.
