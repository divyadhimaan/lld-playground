## Multicore

- A multicore processor is a single computing component with two or more independent actual processing units (called "cores").
- Each core can read and execute program instructions, allowing for parallel processing.
- This means that a multicore processor can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and efficiency for applications that are designed to take advantage of multiple cores. 
- Multicore processors are commonly used in modern computers, smartphones, and other devices to enhance multitasking capabilities and overall system performance.
- Example-
  - Single-core → One worker doing all the jobs sequentially.
  - Quad-core → Four workers doing separate jobs at the same time.
