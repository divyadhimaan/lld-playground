# Design Patterns
Refer [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems that help structure code in a reusable, maintainable, and scalable way. 

In Low-Level Design (LLD), design patterns provide guidelines for implementing class structures, object interactions, and code organization.


## Types of Design Patterns

1. Creational Design Patterns - (Object Creation & Instantiation)
2. Structural Design Patterns - (Object Composition & Relationships)
3. Behavioral Design Patterns - (Object Interaction & Communication)


1. Creational
    1. Prototype - a software development pattern that creates new objects by cloning existing objects. Refer [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
   2. Builder- 
2. Structural
3. Behavioral 
   1. Iterator - lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.). Refer [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)
