# Low-Level Design: Concepts, Code Examples, and Design Examples

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Low-Level Design (LLD), aimed at helping developers understand and implement essential design concepts in software development. It contains a collection of:

- Core Concepts: Key principles and techniques in LLD such as SOLID principles, object-oriented design, and common design patterns.
- Code Examples: Practical Java code implementations showcasing various design techniques, including dependency injection, design pattern usage, and object modeling.
- Design Examples: Step-by-step breakdowns of real-world design problems, with detailed explanations of how to design and architect scalable, maintainable software systems.

- Whether you're preparing for interviews, aiming to improve your design skills, or looking to see best practices in action, this repository provides a solid foundation for mastering Low-Level Design.
