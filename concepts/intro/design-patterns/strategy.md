# Strategy: Design Pattern

>A behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Summary

- You create a `Context class`, that contains `(has-a)` instance of `Strategy interface`.
- The `Strategy interface` is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.
- Using this strategy interface implement `(is-a)` all concrete classes(strategies).
- The `context` calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. It doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.
- The `Client` creates a specific strategy `object` and passes it to the `context`. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.
