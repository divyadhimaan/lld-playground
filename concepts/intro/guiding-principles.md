# Guiding Principles

Guiding principles are rules that software engineers should generally follow

This includes 
- SOLID, 
- tradeoffs between encapsulation, 
- abstraction, 
- inheritance, 
- composition, etc...

## SOLID principles

```S``` - **Single Responsibility Principle**

- A ```class``` should have ```single responsibility```.
- Should not have extra/irrelevant functionalities

    **Goal** - This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it wonâ€™t affect other unrelated behaviours.

```O``` - **Open Closed Principle**

- Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modifications
- Make minimal changes to existing code when introducing new functionality





## DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself
> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
