# Strategy: Design Pattern

>A behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
> 
>  It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.


## When to use Strategy Pattern
- When you have multiple ways to perform a task and want to choose the method at runtime
- When you want to avoid long if-else or switch statements for different behaviors
- When you need to add new algorithms without modifying existing code
- When different classes differ only in their behavior

## Real world analogy
Consider navigation apps like Google Maps. 
You can choose different travel strategies: driving (fastest route), walking (pedestrian paths), cycling (bike lanes), or public transit (bus/train routes). 
The destination remains the same, but the strategy to reach it changes based on your selection.

## Problem Solved

- Eliminates complex conditional statements
- Makes it easy to add new algorithms without changing existing code
- Allows runtime selection of algorithms
- Promotes code reusability and separation of concerns
- Reduces code duplication when multiple classes have similar behaviors



## Summary

- You create a `Context class`, that contains `(has-a)` instance of `Strategy interface`.
- The `Strategy interface` is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.
- Using this strategy interface implement `(is-a)` all concrete classes(strategies).
- The `context` calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. It doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.
- The `Client` creates a specific strategy `object` and passes it to the `context`. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.
